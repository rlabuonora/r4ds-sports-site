<h2>Lab 2</h2>
<p>Download <a href="./rushing.rds">this dataset</a>. It has rushing stats from the 2019 NFL regular season.</p>
<div id="your-job" class="section level3">
<h3>Your job:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new data frame with the rushing stats <em>only for the Quarterbacks</em>.</li>
<li>Create a new <code>data.frame</code> with a new column, <code>rush_attempts_per_game</code>. Use the formula <code>rush_att/games_played</code>.</li>
<li>Create a new <code>data.frame</code> with only the following columns: <code>name</code>, <code>team</code>, and <code>rush_attempts_per_game</code>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Download [this R data file](./nba.rds) and create a plot to understand the relationship between assits and turnovers in the 82 games of the 2017/2018 regular season. -->
<!-- ### Your job: -->
<!-- 1) Think about the data object. What kind of object if is? Use `glimpse` to find out how many variables and observations the object contains. -->
<!-- 2) Think about the aesthetic mappings you want to create. How would you show how the `Playoff` variable affects that relationship? -->
<!-- 3) Think about the geoms you are going to use to represent your data. -->
<!-- 4) Create the same plot to understand the relationship between made 2-pointers and made 3-pointers. -->
