## Lab

1) Use [this dataset](./pbox_long) to create a bar chart with the number of minutes each player of the Houston Rockets played during the regular season. Put the name of each player in the y-axis and order them by the amount of minutes played.

2) User [this dataset](./ff.rds) to create a scatter plot of Offensive Pace vs. Defensive Pace for the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets.
